# Gorth

Gorth is a Go implementation of a simple Forth-like language. It is a work in progress and is not yet feature complete. Heavily inspired by Porth, may even copy some of his code tbh.

## Description

This project is a stack-based programming language implemented in Go. It provides a simple and efficient way to write programs using stack operations.

## Features

-   Basic stack operations: push, pop, swap, duplicate
-   Arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide
-   Comparison and logical operations
-   Control flow: conditional branches and loops
-   Functions or subroutines
-   Basic input/output
-   Error handling
-   Memory management (optional)
-   Concurrency (optional)
-   Debugging tools

## Usage

Have go installed, and run `go run gorth.go`. To test, run `go test`.

As of now, programs on the stack are hardcoded. Will soon get to parsing and reading a program onto the stack.
